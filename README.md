Dijkstra's Algorithm 
is a popular algorithm used for finding the shortest path between nodes in an undirected weighted graph. It was first introduced by the computer scientist Edsger W. Dijkstra and has a wide range of applications, particularly in road networks and transportation systems. By calculating the minimum distance between nodes, Dijkstra's algorithm helps to optimize travel times and improve efficiency in various routing scenarios.
